1. Write a program to Covert cm to foot 
ans:    public class convertion {
        public static void main(String[] args){
        int cm = 165;
        double foot;
        foot = (double) cm/30.48;
        System.out.printf("%d cm is equal to %5.3f foot",cm,foot); //here %5.3f reduces the decimal point to 3 digits
        }
   }

2. Write a program to get the Body Mass Index of a person
ans:    public class bmiCalculator {
        public static void main(String[] args){
        int cm = 165;
        int kg = 70;
        double BDM = (((double)kg/(double)(cm*cm)))*10000;
        System.out.println("Normal Body mass Index: 18.5 and 24.9");
        System.out.printf("Body mass Index of the given height and weight is: %5.2f",BDM);
        }
  }

3.  Write a program to add, multiply, divide and find the remainder od two integer number
ans:    import java.util.Scanner;
        public class calculator {
        public static void main(String[] args){

        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = in.nextInt();
        int b = in.nextInt();
        System.out.println("the addition of the a and b is: "+(a+b));
        System.out.println("the product of the a and b is: "+(a*b));
        System.out.println("the remainder of the a and b is: "+(a%b));
        System.out.println("the division of the a and b is: "+((double)a/(double)b));
    }
}

4. Write a program to check a number even using boolean variable
ans: public class evenCheck {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = in.nextInt();
        boolean value; 
        value = (a > 0);
        System.out.println(a + " is Even: " + value);
    }
}

5. Write a program to check wether the seat is available or not in a theatre using array 
ans:    import java.util.Scanner;
        public class seatCheck {
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter if seat is 1 - if available and 0 - if not available");
        int seat = sc.nextInt();
        String[] aval = {"Not available","Available"};
        System.out.println("the seat is: "+aval[seat]);
    }

}

6.Why is Java not a pure object oriented language
ans: mainly because it supports primitive data types

7. What is JIT compiler
ans: JIT (Just in time), it is used to improving the performance during the run time,
     it can run similar type of funtionality at the same time as it reduces the compilation time.

8.What is instance variable and Local variable
ans: Instance variable: the variable which can be used by all the methods within the class, this is declared outside the method and inside the class
     Local variable: the variable which is declared within a method, function are local variable, they can be used only within the method which they are declared.

9.What is the famous quote in java
ans: WORA (Write Once and Run Anywhere)

10.What are the default values of int, float, String, double, char, boolean instances in java
ans:    Data Type	Default Value (for fields)
        byte	        0
        short	        0
        int	        0
        long	        0L
        float	        0.0f
        double	        0.0d
        char	        '\u0000'
        String   	null
        boolean	        false
