          public static void main(String[] args) {
              Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
              System.out.println("Enter the following options: \n1 - Coffee\n2 - Tea\n3 - Milk");
              int option = sc.nextInt();
      
              switch(option){
                  case 1:
                      System.out.println("Deliver Coffee");
                      break;
                  case 2:
                      System.out.println("Deliver Tea");
                      break;
                  case 3:
                      System.out.println("Deliver Milk");
                      break;
                  default:
                      System.out.println("Enter valid option");
                      break;
              }
          }
      }

2. Write a program to sum first n even numbers using a while loop.
ans:  public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = in.nextInt();
        int i=1;
        int sum =0;
        while(i<=n){
            sum = sum+i;
            i++;
        }
        System.out.println("sum of first n numbers is: "+sum);
    }

3.Write a program to find the factorial of a given number using for loops.
ans: public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = in.nextInt();
        int factorial =1;
       for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
           factorial = factorial*(n-i);
       }
        System.out.println("sum of first n numbers is: "+factorial);
    }
4. Write a program to create a calculator using a function calci in which you send three parameters that is int a, b and String +,-,/,*
ans: public class Calculator {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter the two value to calculate: ");
		int a =sc.nextInt();
		int b =sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println("1 - for addition: \n2 - for substraction: \n3 - for multiplication: \n4 - for division: ");
		int option =sc.nextInt();
		
		System.out.println(calci(a, b, option));

	}

	public static double calci(int a, int b, int option) {
		double result = 0;
		switch (option) {
		case 1:
			result = (double) a +(double) b;
			break;
		case 2:
			result = (double) a -(double) b;
			break;
		case 3:
			result = (double) a *(double) b;
			break;
		case 4:
			result = (double) a /(double) b;
			break;
		default:
			System.out.println("Enter valid option");
			
		}
		return result;
	}
    }

5. Write a program to swap number by using funtion and creating object in class
ans: import java.util.Scanner;
public class random {
	int x;
	int y;

	public void swapNum(random n1)  
	{
		int temp =0;
		temp = n1.x;
		n1.x = n1.y;
		n1.y = temp;
		
	}  
	public static void main(String args[])   
	{
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
		//creating object of the class
		random swap = new random();
		swap.x = in.nextInt(); //initializing variable using object
		swap.y = in.nextInt();
		swap.swapNum(swap);
		System.out.println("x = "+swap.x+" y = "+swap.y);
	}  
}

6.What is the difference between for and while loop
ans: The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known and
     the while loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown.

7.can a single try block have multiple catch block
ans: Yes, but there are certain hierarachy for the catch blocks to be followed.

8. what is the difference between static variable and static methods
ans: Static variables: the variables which are declared indside the class and outside the instance is 
                       statuc variable and this variable can be called in any instance inside the class using the class object
     Static Method: the methods that belongs to the class rather than the instance class are called static method.

9.What will be the output of following program ?
 public class temp
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        int y=4;    
        if(y)
            System.out.println("working fine");
        else
            System.out.println("not working");
    }
}
ans: the above code will give error because the integer value cannot be given within the
     conditional expression, the value should be true or false that is only boolean values.

10. can we use double in the switch case?
ans: No, we can only use int, String, and enum
     enum: An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants
           To create an enum, use the enum keyword (instead of class or interface),
           and separate the constants with a comma. Note that they should be in uppercase letters
