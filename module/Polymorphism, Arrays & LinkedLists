1.write the 2 types of polymorphism
ans: run time polymorphism 
     compile time polymorphism

2.Write a Java program to create a base class Animal (Animal Family) with a method called Sound(). Create two subclasses Bird and Cat.
  Override the Sound() method in each subclass to make a specific sound for each animal.
ans: public class Exercise1 {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Animal cat = new Cat();
        cat.sound();
             Animal bird = new Bird();
             bird.sound();
     
         }
     }
     
     class Animal{
         void sound(){
             System.out.println("woo woo");
         }
     }
     class Bird extends Animal{
         void sound(){
             System.out.println("chirp chirp..");
         }
     }
     class Cat extends Animal{
         void sound(){
             System.out.println("Mew Mew..");
         }
     }

3.Write a Java program to create a class Vehicle with a method called speedUp(). Create two subclasses Car and Bicycle. 
  Override the speedUp() method in each subclass to increase the vehicle's speed differently.
ans: public class Exercise1 {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Vehicle car = new Car();
             car.sound();
             Vehicle cycle = new Bicycle();
             cycle.sound();
     
         }
     }
     
     class Vehicle{
         void sound(){
             System.out.println("Speeding Up");
         }
     }
     class Car extends Vehicle{
         private int speed = 60;
         void sound(){
             System.out.println("the car is at a Speed of: "+this.speed+"km/hr");
         }
     }
     class Bicycle extends Vehicle{
         private int speed = 20;
         void sound(){
             System.out.println("the bicycle is at a speed of: "+this.speed+"km/hr");
         }
     }
